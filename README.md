# Thesis
Here are all the macros and classes used for the final document

The class Sim3.h and the program to run their functions Sim3.C were used to display the historgrams for the 10 000 events simulation of the PHSD, these are the ones I developed with ROOT.

The macro rMC.C is the one I used to display the histiograms for the 10 000 events on the UrQMD.

The readOutput.C macro was used for the distributions on the BE-BE

readOutput6.C and readOutputMBB.C were use for the results involving the miniBeBe
 
 None of the macros was developed by me, but just adapted to perform the analyses following the file arrangements for the PHSD and UrQMD simulations.
